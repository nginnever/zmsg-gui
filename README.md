# zmsg-gui

A javascript based interface for sending messages via zcash encrypted memo fields

Found that bitcoind does not have a CORS path and couldn't get a request from a browser to go through.

Consider building nodejs with client for same origin rpc calls to zcash. This won't run in the browser but it is a potentially quick desktop zmsg application.
